   <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
   <p>
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
        when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
        It has survived not only five centuries,<br>
        but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
        remaining essentially unchanged.<br>

<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
<p>
    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br>
     It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
 </p>
<blockquote>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</blockquote>

<p>Why do we use it?</p>
<pre>
        It is a long established fact that a reader
        will be distracted by the readable content of a page 
        when looking at its layout. 
        The point of using Lorem Ipsum is 
        that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
        as opposed to using
        'Content here, content here', 
        making it look like readable English.
